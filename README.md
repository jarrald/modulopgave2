# Modulopgave 2

## Steps

Prerequisites:

- Remove duplicate words
- Remove words with numbers in them
- Remove words with repeated letters (apparently we've been informed that a letter must only be there once in the crosswords.)
- There are no special characters, at least besides æøå (and é in Olé)

When creating a crosswords puzzle:

- Ensure all letters in the crosswords is only there once.
- Maybe remove crosswords that are mirrored versions of each other? We should get an equal number of results, because for each crosswords puzzle there's a mirrored version, ie. the number of results * 2 -> equal number.
